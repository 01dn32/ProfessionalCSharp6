# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 15, Asynchronous ProgrammingThis chapter contains these samples:* Foundations* ErrorHandling* AsyncPatternsWPFThe Foundations and ErrorHandling samples show core features of using the async/await keywords with C#.The AsyncPatternsWPF demonstrates the advantages of the async/await keywords and shows different async patterns that are used with .NET. To run the application, you need to request a BING key and add it to the BingRequest.cs file in the AsyncLib project, and a Flickr app-id to the file FlickrRequest. You can also request just one of these keys, and just enable the corresponding functionality in the application.
