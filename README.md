# ProfessionalCSharp6
Code samples for the Wrox book Professional C# 6

Samples are updated to .NET 5 Core RC. To compile and run the samples you need:
* Visual Studio 2015
* ASP.NET 5 RC1 Tools (https://get.asp.net/ - click the ASP.NET 5 RC, install for Windows)
* Upgrade to the runtime using >dnvm upgrade from the command line 
* dotnet Tools (https://github.com/dotnet/cli, download and installe the latest MSI package)

With some samples, additional NuGet feeds might be needed. Configure these with Visual Studio 2015:
* .NET Core: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json
* ASP.NET Core: https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetmaster/api/v2
* ASP.NET Core 1.0: https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetcidev/api/v3/index.json

Samples that have been updated to netstandardapp1.5, currently you can't use Visual Studio for compilation. Use the dotnet tools (CLI) instead.
